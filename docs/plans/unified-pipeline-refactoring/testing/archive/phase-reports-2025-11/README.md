## Archive Rationale

These reports were archived to:
1. **Reduce directory clutter** in the active testing area
2. **Maintain historical data** for reference and audit purposes
3. **Focus current testing** on active development phases
4. **Preserve testing artifacts** for compliance and documentation

## Accessing Archived Reports

### For Reference
- Review past testing approaches and methodologies
- Compare current testing results with historical data
- Reference specific test scenarios or edge cases

### For Compliance
- Maintain audit trail of testing activities
- Preserve evidence of phase completion
- Document testing coverage and validation

### For Troubleshooting
- Reference past issues and their resolution
- Compare current problems with historical patterns
- Understand testing evolution over time

## Current Testing Structure

Active testing reports remain in:
- **[../../local-ai-report/](../local-ai-report/)** - Current phase testing reports
- **[../testing-framework.md](../testing-framework.md)** - Testing strategies and approaches
- **[../phase-8-comprehensive-testing-plan.md](../phase-8-comprehensive-testing-plan.md)** - Current phase testing plans

## Archive Maintenance

### Future Archives
- Additional phase reports will be archived as phases complete
- Archive directories will be organized by date: `phase-reports-YYYY-MM`
- Each archive will include this README template for context

### Retention Policy
- All testing reports are preserved indefinitely for compliance
- Archive structure follows monthly organization for easy navigation
- Cross-references maintained in main testing documentation
