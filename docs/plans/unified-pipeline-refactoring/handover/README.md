# Phase Handover Documentation

**Directory**: Phase completion and handover documentation

---

## Overview

This directory contains handover documents created during the implementation of critical phases. These documents capture the state, decisions, and knowledge transfer between phases.

## Files

### 🔄 Phase Handover Documents

- **[phase-6-handover.md](phase-6-handover.md)** - Handover from Phase 6 (AI Enrichment) to Phase 7
- **[phase-7-handover.md](phase-7-handover.md)** - Handover from Phase 7 (Storage) to Phase 8
- **[phase-8-handover.md](phase-8-handover.md)** - Handover from Phase 8 (Orchestrator) to Phase 9
- **[phase-8-testing-handover.md](phase-8-testing-handover.md)** - Testing-specific handover for Phase 8

## Purpose

These handover documents serve as:

### Knowledge Transfer
- **Current State**: System architecture and implementation status
- **Decisions Made**: Key architectural decisions and rationales
- **Lessons Learned**: Insights gained during phase implementation
- **Open Issues**: Outstanding items requiring attention

### Continuity
- **Configuration Details**: System configurations and settings
- **Environment Setup**: Development and production environment details
- **Testing Results**: Comprehensive testing outcomes and validation
- **Performance Metrics**: Baseline and post-implementation performance

### Risk Management
- **Known Issues**: Problems identified and their current status
- **Rollback Procedures**: Emergency rollback steps and procedures
- **Dependencies**: Critical dependencies and their versions
- **Monitoring Setup**: Observability and monitoring configuration

## Usage

### For Phase Leaders
- Review previous phase handover before starting new phase
- Understand system state and known issues
- Follow established patterns and conventions

### For Development Teams
- Use as reference for implementation decisions
- Understand testing requirements and validation procedures
- Follow established deployment procedures

### For Operations Teams
- Reference monitoring and alerting setup
- Understand system dependencies and configurations
- Follow established troubleshooting procedures

## Handover Process

Each handover document follows this structure:

1. **Phase Summary**: Overview of completed work
2. **Current State**: System architecture and implementation details
3. **Key Decisions**: Important decisions and rationales
4. **Testing Results**: Comprehensive testing outcomes
5. **Performance Metrics**: System performance measurements
6. **Known Issues**: Current problems and mitigation strategies
7. **Dependencies**: System dependencies and versions
8. **Next Phase Requirements**: Prerequisites for subsequent phases
