## 💡 Recommendation

**Option 1**: Complete all remaining phases now (3-4 hours)
- Full Option A as requested
- All 11 phases detailed and ready
- Complete single source of truth
- Ready for immediate execution

**Option 2**: Create skeleton phases now, detail as needed (1 hour)
- Create phase files with structure but less detail
- Fill in details as each phase approaches
- Faster to start execution
- More flexible

**Option 3**: Pause here and validate (review what's done)
- Review Phases 1-2 for quality
- Adjust template if needed
- Then batch-create remaining phases
- Ensures consistency
