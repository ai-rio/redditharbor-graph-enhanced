## Success Metrics (90 Days)

### Primary Goals
- **Users:** 500+ free signups
- **Revenue:** 50-100 paying customers
- **MRR:** $10-15k
- **Conversion:** 3-5% free-to-paid
- **Churn:** <8% monthly

### Leading Indicators (Weeks 1-4)
- Week 1: 50+ signups from personal network
- Week 2: 150+ signups from Indie Hackers/Reddit
- Week 3: 300+ signups from Product Hunt
- Week 4: First 10 paying customers

### Decision Triggers
**If hitting goals (Month 3):**
→ Double down on indie hacker market
→ Scale acquisition (ads, content, partnerships)
→ Optimize conversion and retention

**If missing goals (Month 3):**
→ Interview churned users (why didn't they pay?)
→ Pivot positioning or pricing
→ Consider different market segment

---

## Expansion Decision Framework (Month 6)

**DON'T expand unless you see CLEAR signals:**

### Signal 1: Inbound Demand
- ✅ 10+ academics/researchers asking for access
- ✅ 3+ universities requesting institutional licenses
- ✅ 5+ corporate research teams inquiring

### Signal 2: Market Saturation
- ✅ Indie hacker growth slowing (<10% MoM)
- ✅ Market feels "tapped out"
- ✅ Competition increasing in core market

### Signal 3: Strong Foundation
- ✅ $30k+ MRR from indie hackers (proven model)
- ✅ <5% monthly churn (product is sticky)
- ✅ Positive unit economics (LTV > 3x CAC)
- ✅ Product is stable (not constantly fixing bugs)

### Signal 4: Resources Available
- ✅ Cash in bank for 12+ months
- ✅ Time/team bandwidth to build new features
- ✅ Can hire 1-2 people if needed

**If 3+ of these signals exist → Consider expansion**
**If <3 signals → Stay focused on core market**

## Key Principles for Next 90 Days

### 1. Ruthless Focus
Every decision filtered through: "Does this help indie hackers find app opportunities?"
- If yes → Do it
- If no → Don't do it (yet)

### 2. Speed Over Perfection
Ship fast, iterate based on feedback
- Goal: First paying customer in 14 days
- Don't wait for "perfect" product
- Launch with what works NOW

### 3. Build in Public
Share journey transparently
- Weekly updates on Twitter/LinkedIn
- Monthly revenue numbers
- Learning and failures
- Build trust and audience

### 4. Listen Obsessively
Talk to every early customer
- Why did they sign up?
- What value are they getting?
- What's missing?
- Would they refer friends?

### 5. Preserve Optionality
Don't close doors to other markets
- Keep academic features (just don't promote)
- Document research capabilities
- Build flexible infrastructure
- But don't actively sell to non-target markets

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Indie Hackers Won't Pay
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Start with free tier to prove value
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- Show ROI (saves $50k failed build)
- Offer 7-day free trials

### Risk 2: Market Too Small
**Likelihood:** Low (2M+ indie hackers globally)
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Track TAM penetration
- If <0.5% conversion after 12 months, expand
- Keep other markets as backup options

### Risk 3: Someone Copies Us
**Likelihood:** High (good ideas get copied)
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Move fast (be first to market)
- Build data moat (6,000+ opportunities)
- Build brand/community (loyal users)
- Keep innovating (stay ahead)

### Risk 4: Can't Reach Indie Hackers
**Likelihood:** Low (community is accessible)
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**

- Partnership with tools they use
- Content marketing (SEO)

## Summary

**The Strategy:**
Start hyper-focused on indie hackers validating app ideas. Prove product-market fit in 90 days. Reach $10-15k MRR. Then (and only then) evaluate expansion to academic/corporate markets based on clear signals.

**The Bet:**
Indie hackers desperately need affordable market validation. RedditHarbor solves this. We can reach $100k+ ARR in 12 months by owning this niche. Then we have options.

**The Timeline:**
- **Months 1-3:** Launch focused, prove people will pay
- **Months 3-6:** Scale acquisition, optimize conversion
- **Months 6-12:** Either double down on niche OR expand strategically
- **Year 2+:** Platform play or acquisition

**The Goal:**
$100-250k ARR Year 1 from indie hackers alone. Prove the model. Keep options open. Make smart expansion decisions based on data, not assumptions.

**Next Action:** Review docs/business/launch-checklist.md and start Week 1 tasks.
