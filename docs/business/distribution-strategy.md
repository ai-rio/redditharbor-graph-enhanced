## Distribution Philosophy

### The Core Insight

RedditHarbor has a **unique meta-advantage**: The product finds opportunities on Reddit, which means you can demonstrate value BY SHARING what the product finds.

**Traditional SaaS:** "Here's my tool" → "Trust me it works" → "Buy it"

**RedditHarbor:** "Here's an opportunity I found" → "Here's 10 more" → "Want me to find these for you automatically?"

**This is genius** because:
- You're providing value BEFORE asking for money
- You're demonstrating the product works in real-time
- Every piece of content is a product demo
- Your audience (indie hackers) loves this transparency

#### Twitter Growth Tactics

1. **Follow indie hackers and engage genuinely**
   - Comment on their launches
   - Share their wins
   - Offer help before asking for anything

2. **Use hashtags strategically**
   - #buildinpublic (every Monday update)
   - #indiehackers (community posts)
   - #startups (educational content)

3. **Tag relevant people** (when appropriate)
   - @levelsio, @patio11, @swyx (if content is genuinely relevant)
   - Don't spam, only when you add value

4. **Create shareable threads**
   - "10 app ideas validated by Reddit users"
   - "I analyzed 6,000 Reddit posts. Here's what people actually want:"
   - "How to validate demand without spending $10k on research"

**Target:** 1,000 followers in 90 days → 50-100 signups/month

3 years ago, I wasted 6 months building an app nobody wanted.

It failed because I didn't validate demand.

Today, I'm helping entrepreneurs avoid the same mistake.

Here's what I learned about market validation:

[Share insights]
```

**Format 2: Data-Driven**
```
I analyzed 6,000 Reddit discussions to find patterns in what people want.

Top 5 problems people are actively asking for solutions to:

1. [Problem] - 247 discussions, 8% growth
2. [Problem] - 189 discussions, 12% growth
...

This is what real market demand looks like.
```

**Format 3: Thought Leadership**
```
80% of products fail because teams build solutions to problems nobody has.

The alternative isn't expensive market research.

It's listening to where your customers are already discussing problems.

Here's how: [framework]

**Target:** 50-100 signups/month from LinkedIn

## The Meta Advantage (Unique to RedditHarbor)

You have a distribution advantage most SaaS companies don't:

1. **Your product IS the proof**
   - Every opportunity you share demonstrates value
   - You're not asking people to trust you—you're showing them

2. **Endless content**
   - Run your product = generate content
   - Never run out of things to post

3. **Self-referential marketing**
   - "I found this opportunity using Reddit"
   - Posted ON Reddit
   - About using Reddit
   - It's genius

4. **Community alignment**
   - Indie hackers love transparency
   - You're building the tool they need
   - In public
   - With their input

**Use this advantage relentlessly.**

---

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT To Do)

### Don't:
- ❌ Spam communities with "Check out my tool!"
- ❌ Buy fake followers/engagement
- ❌ Overpromise and underdeliver
- ❌ Ignore comments/questions
- ❌ Copy competitor marketing
- ❌ Start paid ads before product-market fit
- ❌ Try to be everywhere at once

### Do:
- ✅ Be genuinely helpful first
- ✅ Build in public transparently
- ✅ Respond to every comment/DM
- ✅ Share learnings, not just wins
- ✅ Focus on 2-3 channels initially
- ✅ Double down on what works

---

## The One Thing

**If you do nothing else from this distribution strategy:**

**Post on Twitter daily for 90 days.**

- Share opportunities you find
- Share learnings
- Help people in replies
- Be transparent about metrics

That alone will get you 500+ signups and 20-50 paying customers.

Everything else is acceleration.

---

## Next Steps

1. **This Week:** Set up Twitter, write 7 days of posts
2. **Week 2:** Launch on Indie Hackers + Product Hunt
3. **Month 1:** Establish daily Twitter habit + weekly blog
4. **Month 2:** Add partnerships
5. **Month 3:** Optimize and scale
