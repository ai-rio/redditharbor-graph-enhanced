## Part 7: Risk Mitigation

### 7.1 Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Reddit API Changes/Pricing**
- **Likelihood:** Medium (happened in 2023)
- **Impact:** High (could break data collection)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Diversify data sources (Twitter, Product Hunt, LinkedIn)
  - Build proprietary historical database (hard to replace)
  - Monitor Reddit API terms closely
  - Have fallback manual collection process

**Risk 2: Low Free-to-Paid Conversion**
- **Likelihood:** Medium (SaaS average is 2-5%)
- **Impact:** High (revenue depends on conversion)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Show clear value in free tier (prove the system works)
  - Use scarcity (limit free opportunities to 5/month)
  - Email nurture sequence (5-7 emails showing value)
  - In-app upgrade prompts at right moments
  - Offer trial of Pro tier (7 days free)

**Risk 3: High Churn Rate**
- **Likelihood:** Medium (novelty wears off)
- **Impact:** High (kills growth)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Deliver consistent value (weekly emails with new opportunities)
  - Build habit loops (daily/weekly engagement)
  - Success stories from community
  - Proactive customer success outreach
  - Annual plans (incentivize commitment)

**Risk 4: Competition**
- **Likelihood:** High (good ideas get copied)
- **Impact:** Medium (first-mover advantage helps)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Build data moat (50k+ opportunities)
  - Build brand/community moat (loyal users)
  - Build proprietary AI models (unique scoring)
  - Move upmarket to enterprise (harder to compete)
  - Patent opportunity scoring methodology (if possible)

**Risk 5: Reddit User Backlash**
- **Likelihood:** Low (but possible)
- **Impact:** Medium (bad PR, community anger)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Be transparent about data usage
  - Respect Reddit's terms of service
  - Don't spam Reddit with promotional content
  - Anonymize all user data
  - Give back to Reddit communities (educational content)

### 7.2 Early Warning Signals

**Watch these metrics closely:**
- Free signup rate declining week-over-week
- Free-to-paid conversion <2% consistently
- Monthly churn >8% for 2+ months
- User engagement declining (fewer opportunities viewed)
- Negative sentiment in community/support tickets

**Action Plan if Warning Signals Appear:**
