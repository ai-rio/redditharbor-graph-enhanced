Final System Test: End-to-End Monetizable App Discovery (DLT-Powered)

This test validates the complete RedditHarbor system according to
the monetizable_app_research_methodology.md:

1. Problem identification from Reddit posts (via DLT pipeline) OR synthetic data
2. AI-powered opportunity scoring (1-3 function constraint)
3. Monetization validation
4. Final app opportunity report
5. Storage in Supabase via DLT (with deduplication)

Expected Results:
- 8-10 valid app opportunities with 1-3 core functions
- Success rate: 80%+
- All opportunities documented with complete metadata
- Data stored in Supabase with merge disposition (no duplicates)

DLT Migration Benefits:
- Automated data loading to Supabase
- Deduplication via merge write disposition
- Incremental state tracking
- Schema evolution support
